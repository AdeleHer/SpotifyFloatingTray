## Android Floating Tray
> * Using Android Floating Widget like Facebook Chat Head let music control panel  float over the screen.
> * import example from <https://www.androidhive.info/2016/11/android-floating-widget-like-facebook-chat-head/>

## Spotify Android SDK
> * Get the music management from Spotify by API provided by Spotify
> * But the only music you can control is the default URI you write in the program
> * You can't control the music you play on Spotify

## Connect both of them
> * This is the practical program by trying Spotify API
> * This is the practical Android App too
